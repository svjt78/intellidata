# IntelliDataSmart

IntelliDataSmart is an AWS cloud-native and web-based/ API-enabled modern data exchange platform for member enrollment in Group Employee Benefits and Healthcare domains. Today, member enrollment (or employee enrollment) for most Group Insurance Carriers, Healthcare providers, Employers (or Groups) and Brokers is a time-consuming (spanning as many as six months in some cases), cost-intensive and a manually-driven business process that “negatively” impacts a number of business KPAs such as the following —

1. Poor Enrollment experience for Employers and Employees
2. High Cost of Enrollment and Reduced Sales Growth for Insurance and Healthcare providers
3. Low Productivity for Brokers
 
Such issues are caused by the lack of a straight-through processing (or lack of a systemic “bridge” ) between the myriad of Benefit Administration Platforms (which are self-serviced front-end enrollment platforms for employers, employees and brokers) and the Insurer’s or the Healthcare Provider’s own backend Systems Of Record (SORs).

The IntelliDataSmart platform bridges that gap by enabling a flexible and automated process with the below set of capabilities that the industry is longing for in this space–

1. Multi-channel Data Ingestion --
    - Bulk data upload, using industry-standard and non-standard data format and schema
    - API based data ingestion and retrieval
    - Online transaction and data stewardship
2. Data Standardization into an Industry-Standard schema
3. Data Storage, with an mutable Transactional Data Store and an immutable Historical Data Store
4. Data quality management
    - Flexible business rule management with the ability for Business to configure data validation rules without the need for IT involvement
    - Early detection of data issues and notification for correction
    - Data administration and stewardship
5. Analytic dashboard to reflect
    - Performance metrics 
    - Data quality metrics
    - Functional metrics 
6. Role-based Authentication and Authorization
7. System administration
8. Event logging
9. Powerful Search facility
10. Well-architected framework and Development best practices of the AWS platform for best-in-class Security, Performance, Availability, and Cost effectiveness
 
In near future more avenues for data ingestion and engagement will be added leveraging AI-based and NLP-based capabilities like Chatbot, OCR, and Speech-To-Text technologies. 

The platform is based upon a scalable framework that is also extensible to other business processes.

 - Django==3.0.8
 - django-bootstrap3==12.1.0
 - djangorestframework==3.11.0
